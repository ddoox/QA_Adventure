Most important - GDPR and acronyms(in other file)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a standardized law for data protection and privacy in the European Union. It regulates the processing of personal data in order to protect it. The term “personal data” relates to any information that makes a person identifiable (also known as PII or personally identifiable information). ”Processing” means any operation such as storing, sharing, collecting, etc. of that personal data.
#### Be aware of the following examples of personal data that is protected by GDPR:

    Name
    Bank details
    IP-address
    ID or passport number
    Email address (for example if it includes your name)
    Photos
    Race
    Ethnic origin
    Political opinions
    Religious or philosophical beliefs
    Genetic data eg. your DNA
    Biometric data eg. fingerprints
    Sexual orientation

Furthermore, remember that not only your own personal data, but also the personal data of others such as your friends, family, colleagues, and third parties fall under GDPR regulations.
