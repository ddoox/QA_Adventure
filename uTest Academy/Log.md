Most important - GDPR and acronyms(in other file)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a standardized law for data protection and privacy in the European Union. It regulates the processing of personal data in order to protect it. The term “personal data” relates to any information that makes a person identifiable (also known as PII or personally identifiable information). ”Processing” means any operation such as storing, sharing, collecting, etc. of that personal data.
#### Be aware of the following examples of personal data that is protected by GDPR:

    Name
    Bank details
    IP-address
    ID or passport number
    Email address (for example if it includes your name)
    Photos
    Race
    Ethnic origin
    Political opinions
    Religious or philosophical beliefs
    Genetic data eg. your DNA
    Biometric data eg. fingerprints
    Sexual orientation

Furthermore, remember that not only your own personal data, but also the personal data of others such as your friends, family, colleagues, and third parties fall under GDPR regulations.

#### Common GDPR violations by testers

At uTest, we have observed the following common GDPR violations by testers in their video recordings which should be avoided:

    Recorded the uTest platform
    Recorded the uTest chat with other customers and tester names visible in the video
    Getting messages and notifications while recording eg. WhatsApp, Facebook, emails, uTest notifications for other projects and customers, etc.
    Receiving calls during recording with the name and phone number visible
    Showing email inboxes with your email address and received emails and senders
    Recording themselves via webcam
    Speaking out loud their names, address, ID-number and other sensitive data
    Pictures from relatives as a background image of the device
    Browser autofill function displays addresses, names, phone numbers, etc.

What is bug, bug reports

Bugs’ presumed severity

    Low severity - A minor incident that impacts the product’s usability, but does not interfere with core features or functionality.
        Page or image misalignment
        Content, spelling, grammatical or punctuation errors
    Medium severity - A minor incident with medium impact that may interfere with core features or functionality, but has a workaround and does not stop further testing or product release.
        Noticeable performance degradation
        A minor inconvenience to customers with a workaround available
    High severity - A major incident with significant impact that interferes with core features and functionality and may stop further testing or delay product release.
        Core functionality is significantly impacted
        A service is unavailable for a subset of customers
    Critical severity - A critical incident with very high impact that interferes with core features and functionality, stops further testing efforts and must be fixed before product release.
        App crashes or freezes
        Confidentiality or privacy is breached
        A customer-facing service is down for all customers


At uTest we categorize bugs into five different types:

    Functional - Work flow failures
    Visual - Layout and user interface distortions or mistakes
    Content - Typos, grammatical issues and localization errors in text
    Performance - Problematic slowness, hanging, or sluggish interface
    Crash - The application quits unexpectedly
