### Day 1
A lot of theory + test scenario/cases

### Day 2
"You understand nothing, learn nothing & produce zero test cases!" - predicted outcome. It wasn't the most pleasant experience ever, but it was possible. Or maybe I've understood something wrong. Time will show.

## Day 3
Created a few Test Cases, waiting for prepared "by experts"

## Day 4
Main differences between mine cases and "experts": I had simpler test case template - without test data and test steps. Overall not too bad. Some info about integration testing. Tomorrow test execution.

##### Summary of the Seven Testing Principles

    Principle 1 	Testing shows presence of defects
    Principle 2 	Exhaustive testing is impossible
    Principle 3 	Early Testing
    Principle 4 	Defect Clustering
    Principle 5 	Pesticide Paradox
    Principle 6 	Testing is context dependent
    Principle 7 	Absence of errors - fallacy
